#### Algorithm Credit

The board evaluation algorithm implemented in
Chessboard.evaluateBoard() is adapted from a formula [found on
chessprogramming.org](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Evaluation). It was
originally derived in 1949 by Claude Shannon, a mathematician, in his seminal
paper _Programming a Computer for playing Chess_.
