/**
 * This package implements a simple chess game played against the AI. For a
 * chess AI, the package implements the minimax algorithm with the alpha/beta
 * pruning optimization. The AI occasionally makes poor choices and could use
 * some further smartening up, but it's sufficient for a game against a chess
 * novice. This package was completed as a self-education exercise to teach the
 * author about implementing algorithms in Java, and use of the Java Swing GUI
 * toolkit. There are no doubt many superior chess games out there, but this one
 * is mine.
